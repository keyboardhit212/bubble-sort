# Bubble Sort
A simple implementation in Java of a sorting algorithm called the Bubble Sort. This program accepts an input of an array of digits **121, 4, 34, 12, 11, 2, 1** and sorts it from the lowest to highest, resulting in an array of digits **1, 2, 4, 11, 12, 34, 121**.

It's time complexity is measured as O(n^2) similar to that of Selection Sort. However with in-depth and comprehensive inspection it is apparent that it runs a little bit slower in comparison with the latter.
